	 * values which you want to configure, presented
	 * in camel case properties names syntax.
	 * 
	 * @param  string                 $name 
	 * Form field specific name, used to identify submitted value.
	 * This value is required for all form fields.
	 * @param  string                 $type 
	 * Fixed field order number, null by default.
	 * @param  int                    $fieldOrder
	 * Form field type, used in `<input type="...">` attribute value.
	 * Every typed field has it's own string value, but base field type 
	 * `\MvcCore\Ext\Forms\Field` has `NULL`.
	 * @param  string|array|int|float $value 
	 * Form field value. It could be string or array, int or float, it depends
	 * on field implementation. Default value is `NULL`.
	 * @param  string                 $translate 
	 * Boolean flag about field visible texts and error messages translation.
	 * This flag is automatically assigned from `$field->form->GetTranslate();` 
	 * flag in `$field->Init();` method.
	 * @param  array                  $controlAttrs 
	 * Collection with field HTML element additional attributes by array keys/values.
	 * Do not use system attributes as: `id`, `name`, `value`, `readonly`, `disabled`, `class` ...
	 * Those attributes has it's own configurable properties by setter methods or by constructor config array.
	 * HTML field elements are meant: `<input>, <button>, <select>, <textarea> ...`. 
	 * Default value is an empty array to not render any additional attributes.
	 * @param  array                  $validators 
	 * List of predefined validator classes ending names or validator instances.
	 * Keys are validators ending names and values are validators ending names or instances.
	 * Validator class must exist in any validators namespace(s) configured by default:
	 * - `array('\MvcCore\Ext\Forms\Validators\');`
	 * Or it could exist in any other validators namespaces, configured by method(s):
	 * - `\MvcCore\Ext\Form::AddValidatorsNamespaces(...);`
	 * - `\MvcCore\Ext\Form::SetValidatorsNamespaces(...);`
	 * Every given validator class (ending name) or given validator instance has to 
	 * implement interface  `\MvcCore\Ext\Forms\IValidator` or it could be extended 
	 * from base  abstract validator class: `\MvcCore\Ext\Forms\Validator`.
	 * Every typed field has it's own predefined validators, but you can define any
	 * validator you want and replace them.
	 * 
	 * @param  bool                   $disabled
	 * Form field attribute `disabled`, determination if field value will be 
	 * possible to change by user and if user will be graphically informed about it 
	 * by default browser behaviour or not. Default value is `FALSE`. 
	 * This flag is also used for sure for submit checking. But if any field is 
	 * marked as disabled, browsers always don't send any value under this field name
	 * in submit. If field is configured as disabled, no value sent under field name 
	 * from user will be accepted in submit process and value for this field will 
	 * be used by server side form initialization. 
	 * Disabled attribute has more power than required. If disabled is true and
	 * required is true and if there is no or invalid submitted value, there is no 
	 * required error and it's used value from server side assigned by 
	 * `$form->SetValues();` or from session.
	 * @param  bool                   $readOnly
	 * Form field attribute `readonly`, determination if field value will be 
	 * possible to read only or if value will be possible to change by user. 
	 * Default value is `FALSE`. This flag is also used for submit checking. 
	 * If any field is marked as read only, browsers always send value in submit.
	 * If field is configured as read only, no value sent under field name 
	 * from user will be accepted in submit process and value for this field 
	 * will be used by server side form initialization. 
	 * Readonly attribute has more power than required. If readonly is true and
	 * required is true and if there is invalid submitted value, there is no required 
	 * error and it's used value from server side assigned by 
	 * `$form->SetValues();` or from session.
	 * @param  bool                   $required
	 * Form field attribute `required`, determination
	 * if control will be required to complete any value by user.
	 * This flag is also used for submit checking. Default value is `NULL`
	 * to not require any field value. If form has configured it's property
	 * `$form->GetDefaultRequired()` to `TRUE` and this value is `NULL`, field
	 * will be automatically required by default form configuration.
	 * 
	 * @param  int                    $minLength
	 * Minimum characters length. Default value is `NULL`.
	 * @param  int                    $maxLength
	 * Maximum characters length. Default value is `NULL`.
	 * 
	 * @param  string                 $autoComplete 
	 * Attribute indicates if the input can be automatically completed 
	 * by the browser, usually by remembering previous values the user 
	 * has entered. Possible values: `off`, `on`, `name`, `email`, 
	 * `username`, `country`, `postal-code` and many more...
